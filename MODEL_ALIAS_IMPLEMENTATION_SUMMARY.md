# Model Alias Support Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Model Alias Support for Claude Code CLI provider, allowing users to easily select the latest Claude models using simple aliases instead of specific version numbers.

## Changes Made

### 1. **ModelAddDialog.tsx**

- Added conditional rendering for Claude Code CLI provider
- Implemented model selection dropdown with three options:
  - Claude Opus (Latest) → `opus`
  - Claude Sonnet (Latest) → `sonnet`
  - Custom Model → user-specified
- Removed model name field for Claude Code CLI (replaced by dropdown)
- Updated "Base URL" label to "Claude Executable Path" for Claude Code CLI
- Removed API Key field for Claude Code CLI (not needed)
- Set default model to "sonnet" when Claude Code CLI is selected

### 2. **ModelEditDialog.tsx**

- Added same model selection dropdown for editing existing models
- Maintained consistency with ModelAddDialog functionality
- Properly handles switching between alias and custom model names

### 3. **Documentation Updates**

- Updated `claude-code-cli-setup.md` with new model selection options
- Clear explanation of three ways to specify models:
  1. Model aliases (opus, sonnet)
  2. Specific model versions
  3. Default model
- Updated UI instructions to reflect new dropdown interface

### 4. **Enhancement Tracking**

- Marked Model Alias Support as completed in `claude-code-cli-enhancements.md`
- Added implementation details and status

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Simplified Model Selection**: Users no longer need to remember exact model version numbers
2. **Future-Proof**: Using aliases ensures users always get the latest model versions
3. **Flexibility**: Still supports custom model names for advanced users
4. **Better Labels**: Clear indication of executable path vs API endpoint
5. **Streamlined Setup**: No API key field reduces confusion

## Technical Details

- Maintains backward compatibility with existing configurations
- No changes to the underlying `ChatClaudeCodeCLI` implementation required
- The CLI already supports the alias flags, so the integration just passes them through
- All builds, tests, and linting pass successfully

## Next Steps

Other potential enhancements from the roadmap:

- Max Turns Control (`--max-turns` flag)
- Verbose Mode (`--verbose` flag)
- Session Persistence (`--continue` and `--resume` flags)
- Output Format Control (`--output-format` flag)
